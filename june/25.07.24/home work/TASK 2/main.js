//21.when you put len- you can in the nexts code line to change the virables,and in constant its fixed
//22.chek with tupeof
//23.everyting became to string-so 105
//24.you need to set the value true or false
//25.when you use premitive data typse you just move the valuble and  when you use in object  thus take you to a lot of data or to function that do complecated calculation.
